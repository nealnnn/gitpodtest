24 Nov 2022 - Created a Github account entered and committed the Readme.md file
21 Jan 2023 - Created and committed this Development Notes file. I'm trying to carefully try to log my notes of learning to use git, github, and gitpod.
21 Jan 2023 - git and github. I'm starting by assuming that a github repository serves as a cloud file system. Github is synchronized with an environment of files on a local machine
  and git allows you to pull, change, commit, merge, and push your files to github (or bitbucket, or other cloud git server). I don't know git well enough
  know if I'm using the right terminology. Note that I think "merge" comes about from a pull-request at another branch that needs to merge with the main
  branch. The git system assumes you are doing development on a fully configured system (image) that has all your development tools as well as all the
  directoies of your development environment. For example, your system would have a C-compiler, a C-code editor, a C-debugger, etc. Your local development
  environment would have all the local project tools, such as bin files, configuration scripts, build scripts, etc.
21 Jan 2023 - gitpod. gitpod is a cloud workspace in which you can build a system to do development. gitpod workspaces are configured with an image
  and development tools that you need for your development. github allows you to do all your development work in the cloud rather than on your own
  machine. When a gitpod workspace fires up, it builds your system and then allows you to pull, change, commit, merge, push with your repository.
21 Jan 2023 - github.dev is a lightweight editor tool provided by github that allows you to navigate files in github and also pull, edit, and commit files.
I'm doing that now with this file. Note that I can also just raw command-line edit this file without the file browser of github.dev
